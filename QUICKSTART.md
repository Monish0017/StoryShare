# Quick Start Guide for StorySharing Platform

## IMPORTANT: MongoDB Atlas Configuration

Before running the application, you MUST configure your MongoDB Atlas connection string:

1. Open `backend/.env`
2. Replace `your_mongodb_atlas_connection_string_here` with your actual MongoDB Atlas URI
3. It should look like: `mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/storysharing?retryWrites=true&w=majority`

## Running the Application

### Terminal 1 - Backend Server
```powershell
cd backend
npm run dev
```

The backend will start on http://localhost:5000

### Terminal 2 - Frontend Development Server
```powershell
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

The frontend will start on http://localhost:5173

## First Time Setup Checklist

- [ ] MongoDB Atlas URI configured in `backend/.env`
- [ ] JWT_SECRET changed to a secure random string in `backend/.env`
- [ ] Both backend and frontend dependencies installed (`npm install`)
- [ ] Backend server running on port 5000
- [ ] Frontend server running on port 5173

## Default Ports

## Troubleshooting
